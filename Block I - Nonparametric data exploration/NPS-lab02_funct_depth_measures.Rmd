## Functional data analysis with R: a primer

Functional Data Analysis is one of the core research areas of our
department, you have already seen during class that some of the
state-of-the-art techniques were actually developed here. Depth-based
techniques find a natural application in Functional Statistics. I assume
that many of you already know what we mean by functional data (applied
statistics course docet), nevertheless do not worry if you do not: I
have structured this lab as a very basic primer to understand how to do
some methodological and applied work in the framework of functional data
analysis (FDA).

According to the FDA model, data can be seen as measurements of a
quantity/quantities along a given, independent and continuous indexing
variable (such as time or space). Observations are then treated as
random functions and can be viewed as trajectories of stochastic
processes defined on a given infinite dimensional functional space.

A natural way to reason (and actually comprehend why they need specific
and peculiar techniques) is to think about them as relatively dense
longitudinal data: unlike tabular data, functional data are not
invariant to permutations of their dimensions (i.e., if I switch two
columns of a standard multivariate dataset no harm is done, if I do it
with a functional one, I will create a bloody mess).

Given its ubiquitous presence in applications FDA has been a very active
research field in the past decades, with a plethora of R packages
developed for helping practitioner efficiently and effectively employ
such techniques. In what follows we will focus our attention on the
`roahd` package (developed by members and former members of our
Department of Mathematics): a package meant to collect and provide
methods for the analysis of univariate and multivariate functional
datasets through the use of robust methods. First off we will dedicate
some time in understanding how to represent these complex infinite
dimensional objects (our computers only deal with finite approximations)
and how to simulate functional data. We will then focus on computation
of depths and outlier detection. This lab WILL NOT provide a thorough
treatment of FDA, but we will limit to study some introductory concepts
on how to deal with univariate (and bivariate, only very briefly)
functional datasets.

## Simulating functional data with roahd package

The way `roahd` package represents functional objects is by providing an
evenly spaced grid $I=\left[t_{0}, t_{1}, \ldots, t_{P-1}\right]$
$\left(t_{j}-t_{j-1}=h>0, \: \forall j=1, \ldots, P-1\right)$ over which
the functional observations $D_{i, j}=X_{i}\left(t_{j}\right)$
$\forall i=1, \ldots, N$ and $\forall j=0, \ldots, P-1$ are measured.
This is very conveniently handled by the `fData` object class. In
particular, the following model is considered for the generation of
data: $$
X(t)=m(t)+\varepsilon(t), \text { for all } t \text { in } I
$$ where $m(t)$ is the mean function and $\varepsilon(t)$ is a centered
Gaussian process with covariance function $C(\cdot,\cdot)$. That is to
say: $$
\operatorname{Cov}(\varepsilon(\mathrm{s}), \varepsilon(t))=C(s, t), \text { with } s, t \text { in } I
$$ The employed structure for $C(s, t)$ is the Exponential covariance
function:

$$
C(s, t)=\alpha e^{-\beta|s-t|}
$$

```{r}
P <- 101
grid <-  seq( 0, 1, length.out =  P)
  
alpha <-  0.2
beta <-  0.2

C_st <- exp_cov_function( grid, alpha, beta )
```

`C_st` contains a $P \times P$ matrix of values.

```{r}
image( C_st,
       main = 'Exponential covariance function',
       xlab = 'grid', ylab = 'grid')
```

After having defined the mean function $m(t)$

```{r}
m <- sin(pi*grid)+sin(2*pi*grid)
```

we are ready to generate functional data as follows

```{r}
n <- 100
set.seed(26111992)
data <- generate_gauss_fdata(N = n,centerline = m,Cov=C_st)
```

The output of the previous chunk is actually a $n \times P$ matrix,
where $P$ is equal to the length of the grid. That is, instead of having
a "proper" functional datum, I have its evaluation on a relatively fine
grid (this is actually the best we can do). We can plot it with:

```{r}
matplot(grid,t(data), type="l", col=adjustcolor(col=1,alpha.f = .4))
lines(grid,m, col="blue", lwd=5)
```

Or even better we exploit the features of the `roahd` package to
construct a functional object:

```{r}
f_data <- fData(grid,data)
plot(f_data) # what happens if I do plot(data)?
lines(grid,m, col="black", lwd=5)
```

The first command defines an object of class fdata

```{r}
class(f_data)
```

with dedicated methods for plots, the four basic algebraic operations,
subsetting and much more. In particular, using objects of class `fdata`
makes the computation of depth measures and related quantities much
easier (see next section). For a thorough account on the potential of
the `roahd` package, check
[this](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019/RJ-2019-032/index.html)
paper.

By changing the hyperparameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the Exponential
covariance function, we can generate functional datum with different
degree of dependence and variability. In details, $\alpha$ controls the
overall level of variability in the signal, while the parameter $\beta$
affects the autocorrelation length of the signal's noise, with lower
values of $\beta$ leading to wider correlation lengths and vice-versa

```{r}
alpha <-  1
beta <-  0.2

C_st <- exp_cov_function( grid, alpha, beta )

data <- generate_gauss_fdata(N = n,centerline = m,Cov=C_st)

f_data <- fData(grid,data)
plot(f_data, main="High overall level of variability")

alpha <-  .1
beta <-  0.0001

C_st <- exp_cov_function( grid, alpha, beta )

data <- generate_gauss_fdata(N = n,centerline = m,Cov=C_st)

f_data <- fData(grid,data)
plot(f_data, main="High smothness") 

alpha <-  .1
beta <-  100

C_st <- exp_cov_function( grid, alpha, beta )

data <- generate_gauss_fdata(N = n,centerline = m,Cov=C_st)

f_data <- fData(grid,data)
plot(f_data, main="Virtually uncorrelated signals") 
```

## Computing depth measures in a FDA framework

Let us now consider the data you have seen in the Case Study: ECG
signals. The registered and smoothed signals are contained in the
`mfD_healthy` object.

```{r}
data("mfD_healthy") # 
univariate_fdata <- mfD_healthy$fDList[[1]] # I consider the first lead only
plot(univariate_fdata)
```

With `roadhd` it is very easy to compute Band depths and Modified band
depths for a given `fdata` object:

```{r}
band_depth <- BD(Data = univariate_fdata)
modified_band_depth <- MBD(Data = univariate_fdata)
```

We can compute the median curve

```{r}
median_curve <- median_fData(fData = univariate_fdata, type = "MBD") # still an fData object
```

Or manually by firstly computing the Modified Band Depth and then
identifying the curve with max MBD

```{r}
median_curve_manual <- univariate_fdata[which.max(modified_band_depth),] # still an fData object
```

```{r}
all(median_curve_manual$values==median_curve$values) 
```

```{r}
plot(univariate_fdata)
grid_ecg <- seq(median_curve_manual$t0,median_curve_manual$tP,by=median_curve_manual$h)
lines(grid_ecg,median_curve_manual$values)
```

Epigraph Index (EI) and Hypograph Index (HI) or their corresponding
Modified versions (MEI and MHI) for providing down-upward/up-downward
order of data can also be computed: see functions `EI`, `HI`, `MEI`,
`MHI`. As an example, let us compute the Spearman's correlation index
between the first and second lead of the ECG signals. Recall that for a
bivariate functional dataset $[\mathbf{x} \mathbf{y}]$

$$
\hat{\rho}_{s}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})=\hat{\rho}_{p}\left(I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}(\mathbf{x}), I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}(\mathbf{y})\right)
$$ where $\hat{\rho}_{p}$ is the sample Pearson correlation coefficient
and $$
\begin{aligned}
&I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}(\mathbf{x})=\left(I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}\left(x_{1}\right), I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}\left(x_{2}\right), \ldots, I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}\left(x_{n}\right)\right) \\
&I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}(\mathbf{y})=\left(I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}\left(y_{1}\right), I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}\left(y_{2}\right), \ldots, I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}\left(y_{n}\right)\right) .
\end{aligned}
$$ where the inferior length grade $I L_{n}-\operatorname{grade}(x_i)$
can be interpreted as the "proportion of time" that the sample
$x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is smaller than $x_i$, that is it defines the relative
position of a curve with respect to the sample.

The Spearman's correlation index is immediately obtained via the
`cor_spearman` function

```{r}
bivariate_data <- as.mfData(list(mfD_healthy$fDList[[1]], mfD_healthy$fDList[[2]]))
plot(bivariate_data)
cor_spearman(bivariate_data, ordering='MHI')
```

Or actually we can manually compute it:

```{r, class.source="extracode"}
MHI_first_lead <- MHI(bivariate_data$fDList[[1]])
MHI_second_lead <- MHI(bivariate_data$fDList[[2]])

cor(MHI_first_lead, MHI_second_lead)
```

Coding tip: never forget the power of functional programming!

```{r, class.source="extracode"}
do.call(args = lapply(1:2, function(ind)
  MHI(bivariate_data$fDList[[ind]])), what = "cor")
```

## Outlier detection with roahd: functional boxplots and outliergrams

We conclude this lab by looking at some graphical tools for identyfing
outliers in a functional sample. Consider the following univariate
functional data

```{r}

alpha <-  0.2
beta <-  0.002

C_st <- exp_cov_function( grid, alpha, beta )

data <- generate_gauss_fdata(N = n,centerline = m,Cov=C_st)

f_data <- fData(grid,data)
```

We consider two cases: first a dataset with some magnitude outliers,
obtained inflating the last 10 curves by a number generated from a
uniform distribution in $[2,3]$

```{r}
set.seed(33) # reproducibility
outlier_share <- .1
n_outliers <-   n*outlier_share
out_highlighter <- rep(c(1,2),c(n-n_outliers,n_outliers))
f_data_temp <- f_data[1:(n*(1-outlier_share)),] # Coding tip: subsetting is mabe possible by the S3 class fdata
mag_temp <- f_data[(n*(1-outlier_share)+1):n,] * runif(10,2,3)

f_data_mag <- append_fData(f_data_temp,mag_temp)
plot(f_data_mag, col=out_highlighter)
```

And then some shape outliers by shifting the generating mechanism by the
quantity `shift_q`:

```{r}
shift_q <- .5

mu_warp=mu=sin(pi*grid+shift_q)+sin(2*pi*grid+shift_q)

shape_temp=generate_gauss_fdata(N = n_outliers, mu_warp, Cov=C_st)
shape_temp=fData(grid,shape_temp)
f_data_shape=append_fData(f_data_temp,shape_temp) 
plot(f_data_shape, col=out_highlighter)
```

Now let us see whether we can employ the two plotting tools we have seen
in class, namely functional boxplots and outliegrams to detect magnitude
and shape outliers, respectively.

```{r}
invisible(fbplot(f_data_mag, main="Magnitude outliers"))
invisible(outliergram(f_data_mag))
```

I used `invisible()` in the previous chunk to avoid the output of the
call to be printed on the console (and in the knitted html file). If I
do not use it I obtain the following:

```{r}
fbplot(f_data_shape, main="Shape outliers")
outliergram(f_data_shape)
```

We appreciate how the shape outliers are almost entirely missed by the
functional boxplot, whereas the outliergram effectively uncovers them.

As usual, saving the output of the plots to an object allows to recover
the ID of the identified outliers:

```{r}
out_shape <- outliergram(f_data_shape, display = FALSE)
out_shape$ID_outliers
```

The outliergram is actually based on some simple manipulations of MEI
and MBD, that can be hard coded:

```{r, class.source="extracode"}
MEI_out_shape <- MEI(f_data_shape)
MBD_out_shape <- MBD(f_data_shape)
a_0 <- a_2 <- -2/(f_data_shape$N*(f_data_shape$N-1))
a_1 <- 2*(f_data_shape$N+1)/(f_data_shape$N-1)
d_manual <- a_0+a_1*MEI_out_shape+a_2*f_data_shape$N^2*MEI_out_shape^2-MBD_out_shape
ID_outliers_manual <- which(d_manual>quantile(d_manual,probs = .75)+out_shape$Fvalue*IQR(x = d_manual))
```

Let us check that our manual computations are correct:

```{r, class.source="extracode"}
all(dplyr::near(d_manual, out_shape$d))
all(ID_outliers_manual==out_shape$ID_outliers)
```

One last comment: we have seen in class that the value $F$ used to build
the fences in the functional boxplot can be adjusted. Despite the
algorithmic implementation/ mathematical theory behind it being quite
tedious, the automated selection of $F$ via the `roahd` package is
actually pretty easy:

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, evNal=FALSE}
set.seed(22)
fbplot(f_data_mag, main="Magnitude outliers",adjust = list(VERBOSE=FALSE))
outliergram(f_data_mag,adjust = list(VERBOSE=FALSE))
```
